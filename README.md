This script calculates the motion of a pendulum which anchor point is moving in the x-axis. There are 2 cases implemented:

1) The velocity has a linear behavior.
2) The velocity has an armonic behavior.

By executing it, you'll 4 plots for each case. The plots show the evolution in time of:
1) The angle \theta, the pendullum angle.
2) Angular velocity, defined as \dot{\theta}.
3) (Potential, Kinetic and Yotal) energy.
4) The motion of the pendulum in the xy-plane.
